// Within your javascript file, create separate JS object literals for each shop location. Each location will be responsible for generating sales data and providing output on an html document.

// Pat will need to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and Pat will also need to be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application.

// So, in addition to building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each location (on a page called sales.html), you also need to create a public-facing page (on the homepage index.html) that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, and informative.
